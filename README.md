 This is a repository of design specifications for Farmacy Foods - a tech. enabled food startup
 
 These specifications were built for Oreilly Architectural Katas 2020.


## Please refer to the Architecture folder for the artifacts created by the team.

 ## Approach:
 1. Synthesize the requirement specification to identify the actors and domains
 2. Identify the architectural characteristics for the system
 3. Create a high level breakdown of features for each domain
 3. Group features into services
 4. Define trade-offs for each service
 5. Design the service - identify technology components for the service
 6. Prototype the service 
 7. Incrementally deploy and test in production by continuously monitoring the telemetry data
 8. Enrich the features 

For the purpose of this Kata, we will work through steps 1 - 4
